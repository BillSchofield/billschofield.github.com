Software Craftsmanship Is Using the Right Set of Tools For Your Context

Good decision making depends heavily upon context. I'm going to delve into the contexts that we encounter as we develop software and how they relate to different software development practices.

Context Awareness
In order to even make a decision based on a context, we need to be aware of the that context. Novice programmers typically are not aware that they need to do anything other than make their program execute in a particular way. As they practice programming and receive instruction, their awareness of their context broadens.

I feel that lack of awareness of our real context is a major contributor to our failures to please our clients and successfully complete our projects. 


Execution speed is important because it will likely be called many times per update.
Readability to Junior programmers is important because this class will be used as a resource for new programmers learning how to add feature to the application.
Unit and acceptance test coverage is important because bugs in this feature cost more to fix or will cause the client to lose more money than other features.



Having the right tool in the toolbox
Awareness of context is only useful if you can do something about it. We have all complained about how hard the code we are working in is to change, but have only had vague solutions to making it better. That is a clue that we had some awareness of our context but not the appropriate skill. Over time as we see a need for a skill/practice we will learn that practice or skill.




Balancing the value and cost of your context


Software craftsmanship is understanding and honoring the 'true' needs of the code at every level of scope. Some of these needs are obvious. For instance, the code needs to compile and do something. Beyond these simple examples, it's not always clear what should be steering the way we implement a feature. Does performance trump flexibility? Is speed a bigger concern than fragmentation? To answer these questions we need to have a deep understanding of the context we are working in.



Understanding the Context to Reveal the Needs

As we gain experience as programmers our ability to perceive these constraints grows. An apprentice programmer is concerned with getting each feature to work and blindly obeying the coding standard. He may have some vague ideas about code reuse and performance, but can't articulate them. A master perceives many conflicting constraints and can articulate them to their customer in a way that shows their business value and cost.



These needs conflict. 
	Masters can find new ways to meet more than one need. 
	They can also prioritize these conflicting needs.
Long-term vs. short-term
Performance vs. flexibility

Honoring the Needs

Levels of Scope


Two Topics

Programming is about understanding the context and using that context to honor the right constraints in code
Gathering this context is an exercise in communication between stake-holders with very different perspectives. The result is greater than the sum of the parts and is how great software is made. Design and Scheduling are a single activity that is the conversation that develops a shared understanding of this context.

Most of constraints that we need to understand come from our customer (or client). Often they are unaware that these constraints are valuable to them. Part of our job as developers is to develop a shared understanding of context of the project with the client and developers from other disciplines (like art and design).

Design and scheduling are one activity.
