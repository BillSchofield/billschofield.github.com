title: Your Exocortex and You!
---

Bringing together two similar concepts from:
Pragmatic Thinking and Learning (Andy Hunt)
Getting Things Done (David Allen)

Andy Hunt’s definition of exocortex is your memory or processing systems that live outside your physical brain. 

We all have an existing exocortex. We make lists, calendars, keep emails, etc.

What we don’t often do is intentionally optimize and maintain our exocortex. That’s what I want to focus on now.

Ways to use your exocortex:
Make a note when you have an idea
Schedule everything
Whenever you have to look up a piece of information, record it.
Enumerate your tasks and projects

Ways to optimize your exocortex
Create a trusted system
Written content repository
Electronic calendar
Project/task list
Make your exocortex ubiquitous
Remove duplication
Only one location for each concept
Use version control
Use references and links
Remove/transform cruft
Empty inbox (this is important)
Delete obsolete notes, tasks, projects
Maintain your exocortex
Group similar concepts
Weekly reflection on projects & tasks (next tasks)
