# Building relationships
Building relationships is key to consulting success
What does my behavior look like to the person I want to build a relationship with?

## Consider your Context
Be aware of your context
* Private
* Who is your audience?
* Who is aware of you?
* What are the norms for the current context?
** Dress
** Drinking
** Language
** Having fun
** Role relationship
** Work hours, sick time, etc.

## Conflicting norms
How do we handle the clash between TW and client cultures?
Consciously judge what your behavior should be
Consider what your behavior looks like to the client
* While working
* Social Events

Who must we consider?
* Our client and others we work with
* Our TW colleagues

## Professionalism
* What does this mean in the current context?
* What makes the best impression?
* We are here to serve

## Taking Risks
* Is the average result a win?
* Is the worst case result tolerable?

## Listen
Develop at least a basic understanding of the situation before you advise
* Ask the client for some possible solutions (ask many people)
* Ask what success looks like
* Really listen when people talk (use your best listening skills, don’t just wait to talk)
* Be positive
* It’s cheesy, but framing a problem an opportunity can totally change how your advice is received.
* Smile!

## Don’t focus on what we can’t do; instead focus on what is possible

## Confidence + Humility == Awesome
