Quotes:
"Communication is what the listener does" -Mark Horstman
"The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place." -George Bernard Shaw
"To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others." -Tony Robbins

Wikipedia:
Communication (from Latin "communis", meaning to share) is the activity of conveying information through the exchange of thoughts, messages, or information, as by speech, visuals, signals, writing, or behavior.
Communication requires a sender, a message, and a recipient
Seek to understand before seeking to be understood.

Speaking
As consultants, when we communicate it is our job to meet our clients where they are. This means that we need to consider who they are when we speak to them and when we hear what they have to say. This is a major motivation for improving our ability to understand ourselves and others.

What are the listener's interaction style preferences?
	BLUF

What is their current context?
What positional role is the listener in:
Top
Middle
Bottom
Client
Service provider?

How is the listener reacting to what they hear?
Body language
Word cues
Language:
Specific words can make it harder for the listener to hear your message:
But - erases everything said before it. "I like you, but you complain it get on my nerves."
Should, try - implies that it would be better for someone to do one thing over the other without determining whether they will. "I should exercise more." versus "I will exercise for 30 minutes every night before I do anything else." versus “I could exercise more.”

Absolutes: Always, never, all, can't

Tools that build relationships:
"Can you help me with <X>?" instead of "I need you to <X>."
Use peoples' names.
Smile when you make eye contact. Don't try to fake this.


Listening
On average, people are not good at listening. Here are some simple steps you can take to be a better listeners (and be perceived as a great listener):
Face the speaker
Smile
Make regular eye contact
Nod your head
Take notes if appropriate
Active listening is a communication technique that requires the listener to feed back what they hear to the speaker, by way of re-stating or paraphrasing what they have heard in their own words, to confirm what they have heard and moreover, to confirm the understanding of both parties.

When interacting, people often "wait to speak" rather than listening attentively. They might also be distracted. Active listening is a structured way of listening and responding to others, focusing attention on the "function" of communicating objectively as opposed to focusing on "forms", passive expression or subjectivity.

Try to understand the message that is being sent to you. What point is the speaker trying to make. Help them communicate better.


More communication:

Dialog: Holding the topic of communication separate from ourselves. Dropping ego attachment to "our" ideas and discussing them as "objects held at arms length".

Communication is what the listener hears, not what the speaker says.
