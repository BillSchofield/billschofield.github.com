Communication
tl;dr from Communication
Communication is what the listener does
It is the speakers job to communicate so the listener can understand the message they are trying to send
It is important for the speaker to understand the listener well enough that she can change her communication patterns to suit the listener

This means that we have to understand other people in order to effectively communicate with them.

Unfortunately, humans have tendencies that hinder our ability to shift our perspective to that of our audience. One of our biggest challenges is that our brains tell us that we should expect everyone to “Be Like Me”.

Be Like Me
We all have a natural tendency to perceive the world through a lens that is unique to each of us. Our experience, personality and environment are the biggest contributors to
coloring this lens and we tend to expect others to think and behave as we do. This often leads to dismissing or devaluing others simply because they have not do not have the same experience, personality, or environment as we do.


Ways that we expect people to be like us:
Personality (Extroversion is good, introversion is bad)
Work Role (The BAs are stupid because they don’t understand why code quality matters)
Organizational Role (My manager is an idiot; can’t he see that these milestones are unworkable)
Life Experience (My last project failed because we didn’t plan enough. We should do more planning on all future projects.)
Personal preference (How can you possibly like Justin Bieber?)


The more we are able to understand the differences between people and accept that those differences are not only valid, but also wonderful and helpful.

If a team is composed of very similar people then we are much more likely to make the same mistake than if we are different. What are some examples of this?

This is what diversity is all about. Our differences make us powerful together.


Tools for fighting BLM:

Understand how people can be different, so you can value their differences instead of dismissing them.
Mental models, like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or Organizational Roles
from Seeing Systems can help us understand how and why people might behave very differently than we do.

Everything that someone does makes sense to them at the time. 
When someone does something that looks strange or wrong to you, try to understand how it could make sense to them.
When someone says something that we don't agree with, it is normal to try to figure out
why they are wrong and we are right. This is the status quo for humans even though it is
counterproductive.

Seek to understand before seeking to be understood.
- Steven Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
Remember that everyone has a different perspective and has context that you don’t. By seeking to understand, you are likely to either discover the key information that they have that you don’t or vice-versa. You are also likely to discover that since neither of you has a complete picture, there is a third answer that you can discover together than neither of you could find alone.


Be Like Them
Sometimes we feel bad about ourselves because we are different from other people. We perceive that we are broken or wrong, while others are “right”. If we understand ourselves better we can understand why our differences are powerful and how we can best use our unique strengths.
