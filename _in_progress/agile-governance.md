Agile Governance: Roles & Accountabilities

Intro
I’m going to talk JIT Roles & Accountabilities. These are two of the interlocking practices of Holacracy, which is a broader governance system. Imagine that I am presenting about TDD without discussing XP in detail.

Holacracy is a governance system that allows organizational structure to evolve as the organization discovers what its needs are. Hierarchy, roles, and accountabilities come into existence as individuals doing what they think is best proves to be insufficient.


Agile teams typically have a small number of loosely defined roles and lean heavily on the practice of Self-organizing teams to sort out what should happen. This is a great place to start, but unlike every other XP practices there are no tools or examples to guide the team to successfully self-organizing.

Retrospectives are a key part of the governance of agile teams and they do a great job of enumerating and prioritizing our tensions. This is a divergent activity that yields lots of high quality information about what we want to change. 

Retros typically don’t do a good job of converging to a useful result. There is not a consistently used way of processing the tensions that emerge during the retro. Most often we assign a task to a small group of people believing that this will solve the issue at hand.

Retros are not the right context to solve these problems because they include the entire team and don’t have a workable process for converging to a good result. This is the big opportunity to introduce more structure to how we govern ourselves.


Accountabilities

Typically, organizations create roles before they need them, fill them with a specific person. These roles either have a vague job description or a long shopping list of responsibilities that rarely map well to what the person actually does.

Instead of trying to predict what work each person is going to do on a team, we could instead start with a team that has a well understood Aim and steer how that team works as tensions arise from real work.



Intro

I recently attended an Agile Governance Workshop ...

Most agile methodologies stress the importance of self-organizing teams and provide only general guidance about what that means. In real life most teams don't have time to develop a good system for self-governance and default to something like: Chaos, Loudest Voice, Conventional Leader, Consensus, or Democracy.
I'd like to introduce you to a set of practices that are light-weight and help teams do just-in-time governance by adding roles, accountability, and policies only in response to a real world tension felt by someone on the team.

Key Concepts
Just In Time Governance via tensions
ID using objections instead of voting
Double linked hierarchy


Just In Time Governance via tensions
Predict and control


Key concepts
Organizational structure
	Roles & accountabilities
Dynamic circles
Double Linking

Organizational Control
Dynamic Steering
Integrative Decision-making

Facilitated Meetings
Governance
Operational

Getting the work done
Work within your roles and accountabilities
Work with other explicit roles
Take individual action
Synchronize at operational meetings
Formalize at governance meetings
Leadership
Is distributed through all levels of scope and all roles
Lead links bring accountabilities with them from a higher level of scope (conventional leadership)
