"The Eisenhower Method" is a used time management practice often used to improve personal effectiveness by clarifying our work by its urgency and importance. 
I believe that teams often fall into the same prioritization traps as individuals and that we would benefit from explicitly categorizing team work items. We'll take a 
quick look at how the Eisenhower Method works for individuals and then apply it to work items commonly seen by software teams.

The Eisenhower Method

Example of Software Development Tasks
Feature that will make some money this quarter
Feature that will make some money every quarter
Clean up automated tests so that all future feature are 5% easier to develop
Model our Domain as we currently understand it
Prioritize features for next month
