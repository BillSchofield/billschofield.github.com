title: Dealing with Your Tensions
---



# Dealing with the stress caused by the tension
Work is hard. That’s why it’s called work.
At some level of scope each problem is an opportunity (this sounds like a cop-out).
Share your tensions, your teammates can help. This is not the same as complaining.
Train your brain to be happy:
Choose your words carefully (could instead of should, and instead of but)
Smile more and look up
Say positive things
Take time to recharge your emotional batteries (this is different for everyone).
Ignore it. Maybe it’s just not worth worrying about.

Addressing the source of the tension
Agile Consultants are supposed to challenge the status quo
Is there a policy or responsibility at your level of scope that could address it
Broadcast the issue to those who could address it at their level of scope
