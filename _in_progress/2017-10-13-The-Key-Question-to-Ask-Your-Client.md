title: The Key Question to Ask Your Client
---
I had a realization a couple of years ago that I was failing to ask my clients a key question and that both my teams and 
my client were in a lot of pain because our discussions weren’t aligned with each other.

The repeated patterns of many projects looked like this:

The client says, “We need to go fast right now, so don’t {refactor, pair program, test drive, write automated tests}!” 
We’d react by either not doing that important practice or by ignoring our clients (or some combination). This rarely led 
to a happy team or client and certainly wasn’t effective for either.

> The client or the team decides that we need to work extra hours this iteration and focus on visible results over 
investing in internal quality so we can “get enough done” this iteration because “it’s the most important iteration of 
the project”. Then we do the same thing the next iteration, the iteration after that, and so on...

> Some experienced team members might try to have a conversation with the client about the team being experts at 
building software and the client is not an expert, so the client should just trust us to do a good job. This usually f
reaks out the client because they need these features done ASAP and it sounds like the team is not in any rush to 
actually get finished.

Another way we attempt to solve whatever the underlying problem is to try to give the client a different knob to turn 
other than “get more work done this week”. Clients usually feel powerless and the only tool they perceive is to yell 
louder about getting more work done now. We often talk about using velocity to predict how much will get done by a 
certain date and that the client can make business decision about **what** will get done by that date but can’t dictate 
**how much** will get done by that date. This helps some because it shows the client that they have more power and control than 
they thought, but we’re really saying to them, “You’re going to get less than you want.” This also doesn’t address that 
the client still wants us to go faster.

The business decision that our clients can make that will inform both our technical and business priorities is: 
**“What time frame should we prioritize over all others?”**

What this question does is clarify that in order to go fast this week, we will need to go slower next week and if we 
want to get the most done over the next year, we will need to invest more time this week into going well.
