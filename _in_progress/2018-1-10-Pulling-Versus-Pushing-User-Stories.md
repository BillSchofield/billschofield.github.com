## Pulling versus Pushing Work (Applying Lean Thinking to User Stories)
On many occasions, I've had a project manager tell me that they thought
that I should be working on the next user story or that the story I was
currently working on was finished.

The conflict that arose from these topics was invariably about the story
looking complete and yet there still being internal quality improvements
relating to learning that had occured while we implemented that story.

Until recently, I didn't have a good way of resolving this conflict and
all I could contribute was, "It feels like you don't trust me to do the
right thing." While this might have been true, the valuable opportunity
for me was to add visibility into what I was doing and why it was a
valuable behavior.

The metaphor that I use for this now is that of a fictional automobile
assembly-line worker who puts bolts on cars.
